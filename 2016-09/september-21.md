## September 21 ([discuss](https://github.com/webpack/meeting-notes/pull/14))

### Attendees

* [Tobias Koppers](http://github.com/sokra)
* [Sean Larkin](http://github.com/thelarkinn)
* [Juho Vepsäläinen](http://github.com/bebraw)


### Agenda

#### Documentation Updates

* Juho is going to start working on [antwar/antwar#103](https://github.com/antwarjs/antwar/issues/103) next week.

* Big styling [PR merged](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/pull/174). Styling is looking very good, with more responsive changes coming later. 

* Mobile support? 

	* Being tracked via [#183](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/issues/183)

* Add changelog section for docs page: 
	
	* Link to [releases page](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases)

* Should clarify `concepts` vs `api` vs `configuration` sections what they mean, etc. 

* At 45% completion now. Will still want to post a publication (when we have time that has a clear call to action explaining exactly what remains for webpack 2 docs to be satisfied).

#### Analytics 

* Sean whipped up a proof of concept plugin: [AnalyticsWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/thelarkinn/AnalyticsWebpackPlugin) for us to use in the future in core. 

* When we get near to releasing, maybe we want to start collecting usage statistics in hopes to collecting useful data for target documentation, support, and more. Fine tuning from the community is always welcomed. The repo can be a proof of concept before we consider merging it to core.

#### Project Boards

* New [project boards](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/projects) (thanks github!).

* Share the [help wanted board](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/projects/2)!!

* Would love to find better ways to manage the board as issues tied to them get managed, maybe something we will have to wait for the community to catch up with.
