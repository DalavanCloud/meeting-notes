### Agenda

#### Discussed Roadmap 

* Most important feature is documentation for Webpack 2.0. 
* There is a lot of great overlap with SurviveJs Book and Juho mentioned his willingness to take the lead on documentation. 
* Agreed that the Roadmap documentation should reflect bugs which have been fixed, as well as bugs that still are critical blocking for 2.0

#### 2.0 Documentation.
  
* New Repo (and new page? webpack.io? (looks like domain grabber owns it))
* Sean mentioned that the angular team uses a 3rd party for angular.io, and potentially we could investigate the same thing. (Maybe even a team willing to put out their brand on our page if they did it or a portion or all for free). 

#### Tobias added a new AgressiveSplittingPlugin for webpack 2.0
  
* Support HTTP2 caching level 4

#### Bounty Sourcing / Sponsorship
  
* Sean mentioned that he is in communication with parties who are investigating the possibility of sponsorship or ‘helping’ in some way. He will find out more information on this today for next meeting.

#### Weekly Meetings
  
* Everyone agreed that meeting weekly to continue transparency.
* Meeting notes will be published to webpack/meeting notes.
* Next meeting slated for Jun. 29th 2016
